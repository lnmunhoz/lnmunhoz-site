I'm a Software Engineer in living in Bangkok, Thailand. I currently work at [Envisioning](https://envisioning.io) where I work as a Lead Developer. In my free help other developers on, [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/lnmunhoz), 



I am a full stack developer with 5+ years of experience. I love to create stuff for the web and discover new technologies. I have a strong background with JavaScript, Meteor, MongoDB and React.

I also appreciate helping other developers solving their problems. Everytime a friend or someone that I met in the coworkings or coffeshops ask for help, I try to do my best to help him and we always end up having a nice chat.

Programming in something you become good at it just if you time a good amount of time and effort **consistently**. And people with experience should always be willing to help the ones staring the journey.
